<p>1 . <strong>Responsibility of Website Visitors.</strong> 1Hora has not reviewed, and cannot review, all of the material, including computer software, posted to the Website, and cannot therefore be responsible for that material's content, use or effects. By operating the Website, 1Hora does not represent or imply that it endorses the material there posted, or that it believes such material to be accurate, useful or non-harmful. You are responsible for taking precautions as necessary to protect yourself and your computer systems from viruses, worms, Trojan horses, and other harmful or destructive content. The Website may contain content that is offensive, indecent, or otherwise objectionable, as well as content containing technical inaccuracies, typographical mistakes, and other errors. The Website may also contain material that violates the privacy or publicity rights, or infringes the intellectual property and other proprietary rights, of third parties, or the downloading, copying or use of which is subject to additional terms and conditions, stated or unstated. 1Hora disclaims any responsibility for any harm resulting from the use by visitors of the Website, or from any downloading by those visitors of content there posted</p>

<p>2 . <strong>Content Posted on Other Websites.</strong> We have not reviewed, and cannot review, all of the material, including computer software, made available through the websites and webpages to which getblimp.com links, and that link to getblimp.com. 1Hora does not have any control over those non-1Hora websites and webpages, and is not responsible for their contents or their use. By linking to a non-1Hora website or webpage, 1Hora does not represent or imply that it endorses such website or webpage. You are responsible for taking precautions as necessary to protect yourself and your computer systems from viruses, worms, Trojan horses, and other harmful or destructive content. 1Hora disclaims any responsibility for any harm resulting from your use of non-1Hora websites and webpages</p>

<p>3 . <strong>Copyright Infringement and DMCA Policy.</strong> As 1Hora asks others to respect its intellectual property rights, it respects the intellectual property rights of others. If you believe that material located on or linked to by getblimp.com violates your copyright, you are encouraged to notify 1Hora in accordance with The Digital Millenium Copyright Act of 1998 ("DMCA"). 1Hora will respond to all such notices, including as required or appropriate by removing the infringing material or disabling all links to the infringing material. In the case of a visitor who may infringe or repeatedly infringes the copyrights or other intellectual property rights of 1Hora or others, 1Hora may, in its discretion, terminate or deny access to and use of the Website. In the case of such termination, 1Hora will have no obligation to provide a refund of any amounts previously paid to 1Hora</p>

<p>4 . <strong>Intellectual Property.</strong> This Agreement does not transfer from 1Hora to you any 1Hora or third party intellectual property, and all right, title and interest in and to such property will remain (as between the parties) solely with 1Hora 1Hora, getblimp.com, the Blimp logo, and all other trademarks, service marks, graphics and logos used in connection with getblimp.com, or the Website are trademarks or registered trademarks of 1Hora or 1Hora's licensors. Other trademarks, service marks, graphics and logos used in connection with the Website may be the trademarks of other third parties. Your use of the Website grants you no right or license to reproduce or otherwise use any 1Hora or third-party trademarks.</p>

<p>5 . <strong>Changes.</strong> 1Hora reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to modify or replace any part of this Agreement. It is your responsibility to check this Agreement periodically for changes. Your continued use of or access to the Website following the posting of any changes to this Agreement constitutes acceptance of those changes. 1Hora may also, in the future, offer new services and/or features through the Website (including, the release of new tools and resources). Such new features and/or services shall be subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement.</p>

<p>6 . <strong>Termination.</strong> 1Hora may terminate your access to all or any part of the Website at any time, with or without cause, with or without notice, effective immediately. If you wish to terminate this Agreement or your getblimp.com account (if you have one), you may simply discontinue using the Website. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if you have a Paid Services account, such account can only be terminated by 1Hora if you materially breach this Agreement and fail to cure such breach within thirty (30) days from 1Hora's notice to you thereof; provided that, 1Hora can terminate the Website immediately as part of a general shut down of our service. All provisions of this Agreement which by their nature should survive termination shall survive termination, including, without limitation, ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, indemnity and limitations of liability.</p>

<p>7 . <strong>Disclaimer of Warranties.</strong> The Website is provided "as is". 1Hora and its suppliers and licensors hereby disclaim all warranties of any kind, express or implied, including, without limitation, the warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose and non-infringement. Neither 1Hora nor its suppliers and licensors, makes any warranty that the Website will be error free or that access thereto will be continuous or uninterrupted. You understand that you download from, or otherwise obtain content or services through, the Website at your own discretion and risk.</p>

<p>8 . <strong>Limitation of Liability.</strong> In no event will 1Hora, or its suppliers or licensors, be liable with respect to any subject matter of this agreement under any contract, negligence, strict liability or other legal or equitable theory for: (i) any special, incidental or consequential damages; (ii) the cost of procurement or substitute products or services; (iii) for interruption of use or loss or corruption of data; or (iv) for any amounts that exceed the fees paid by you to 1Hora under this agreement during the twelve (12) month period prior to the cause of action. 1Hora shall have no liability for any failure or delay due to matters beyond their reasonable control. The foregoing shall not apply to the extent prohibited by applicable law.</p>

<p>9 . <strong>General Representation and Warranty.</strong> You represent and warrant that (i) your use of the Website will be in strict accordance with the 1Hora <a href="http://1hora.org/privacy">Privacy Policy</a>, with this Agreement and with all applicable laws and regulations (including without limitation any local laws or regulations in your country, state, city, or other governmental area, regarding online conduct and acceptable content, and including all applicable laws regarding the transmission of technical data exported from the United States or the country in which you reside) and (ii) your use of the Website will not infringe or misappropriate the intellectual property rights of any third party.</p>

<p>10 . <strong>Indemnification.</strong> You agree to indemnify and hold harmless 1Hora, its contractors, and its licensors, and their respective directors, officers, employees and agents from and against any and all claims and expenses, including attorneys' fees, arising out of your use of the Website, including but not limited to your violation of this Agreement.</p>

<p>11 . <strong>Payment, Refunds, Upgrading and Downgrading.</strong> All paid plans must enter a valid credit card. Free accounts are not required to provide a credit card number. An upgrade from the free plan to any paying plan will immediately bill you. The Website's service is billed in advance on a monthly basis and is non-refundable. There will be no refunds or credits for partial months of service, upgrade/downgrade refunds, or refunds for months unused with an open account. In order to treat everyone equally, no exceptions will be made. All fees are exclusive of all taxes, levies, or duties imposed by taxing authorities, and you shall be responsible for payment of all such taxes, levies, or duties, excluding only United States (federal or state) taxes. For any upgrade or downgrade in plan level, your credit card that you provided will automatically be charged the new rate on your next billing cycle. Downgrading your Service may cause the loss of Content, features, or capacity of your Account. 1Hora does not accept any liability for such loss.</p>

<p>12 . <strong>Modifications to the Website's service and prices.</strong> 1Hora reserves the right at any time and from time to time to modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, the Service (or any part thereof) with or without notice. Prices of all Services, including but not limited to monthly subscription plan fees to the Website's service, are subject to change upon 30 days notice from us. Such notice may be provided at any time by posting the changes to the 1Hora Site (getblimp.com), elweb blog (elweb.co) or the Website itself. 1Hora shall not be liable to you or to any third party for any modification, price change, suspension or discontinuance of the Website's service.</p>

<p>13 . <strong>Miscellaneous.</strong> This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between 1Hora and you concerning the subject matter hereof, and they may only be modified by a written amendment signed by an authorized executive of 1Hora, or by the posting by 1Hora of a revised version. Except to the extent applicable law, if any, provides otherwise, this Agreement, any access to or use of the Website will be governed by the laws of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, excluding its conflict of law provisions, and the proper venue for any disputes arising out of or relating to any of the same will be the state and federal courts located in San Juan, Puerto Rico. Except for claims for injunctive or equitable relief or claims regarding intellectual property rights (which may be brought in any competent court without the posting of a bond), any dispute arising under this Agreement shall be finally settled in accordance with the Comprehensive Arbitration Rules of the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Service, Inc. ("JAMS") by three arbitrators appointed in accordance with such Rules. The arbitration shall take place in San Juan, Puerto Rico, in the English language and the arbitral decision may be enforced in any court. The prevailing party in any action or proceeding to enforce this Agreement shall be entitled to costs and attorneys' fees. If any part of this Agreement is held invalid or unenforceable, that part will be construed to reflect the parties' original intent, and the remaining portions will remain in full force and effect. A waiver by either party of any term or condition of this Agreement or any breach thereof, in any one instance, will not waive such term or condition or any subsequent breach thereof. You may assign your rights under this Agreement to any party that consents to, and agrees to be bound by, its terms and conditions; 1Hora may assign its rights under this Agreement without condition. This Agreement will be binding upon and will inure to the benefit of the parties, their successors and permitted assigns.</p>
